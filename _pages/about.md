I am currently a third year undergraduate Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of Technology. My primary interests in research include Applied Computing, Data Science, Computational Science, Computational Aviation Safety and High Performace Computing. 

Some of my current research projects include work on the <a href="https://ngafid.org/">National General Aviation Flight Information Database (NGAFID)</a>, under the advisement of Prof. <a href="https://www.rit.edu/directory/tjdvse-travis-desell"> Travis Desell, Ph.D.</a> The NGAFID is is part of Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS), a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) funded, joint government-industry, collaborative information sharing program to proactively analyze broad and extensive data sources towards the advancement of safety initiatives and the discovery of vulnerabilities in the National Airspace System (NAS). Some enhancements I have made include a tool for pilots to monitor an aggregate of crucial flight parameters through new indicies that allow for the recognition and mitigation of dangerous flight conditions.
